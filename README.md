Fusuma is multitouch gesture recognizer.
This gem makes your linux able to recognize swipes or pinchs and assign commands to them.

襖(Fusuma) means sliding door used to partition off rooms in a Japanese house.

## Features

- Easy installation with RubyGems
- Defining Gestures and Actions in YAML
- Sensitivity setting (threshold, interval) for gesture recognition
- Automatic device addition for reconnecting external touchpads
- Extension of gesture recognition by [plugin system](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma/#fusuma-plugins)

## Installation

### Grant permission to read the touchpad device

**IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** be a member of the **INPUT** group to read touchpad by Fusuma.

```bash
$ sudo gpasswd -a $USER input
```

Then, You apply the change with no logout or reboot.

```bash
$ newgrp input
```

### For Debian Based Distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Pop!OS)

#### 1. Install libinput-tools

You need `libinput` release 1.0 or later.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libinput-tools
```

#### 2. Install Ruby

Fusuma runs in Ruby, so you must install it first.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ruby
```

#### 3. Install Fusuma

```bash
$ sudo gem install fusuma
```

#### 4. Install xdotool (optional)

For sending shortcuts:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install xdotool
```

### For Arch Based Distros (Manjaro, Arch)

#### 1. Install libinput.

You need `libinput` release 1.0 or later. This is most probably installed by default on Manjaro

```z-h
$ sudo pacman -S libinput
```

#### 2. Install Ruby

Fusuma runs in Ruby, so you must install it first.

```zsh
$ sudo pacman -S ruby
```

#### 3. Install Fusuma

**Note:** By default in Arch Linux, when running ```gem```, gems are installed per-user (into ```~/.gem/ruby/```), instead of system-wide (into ```/usr/lib/ruby/gems/```). This is considered the best way to manage gems on Arch, because otherwise they might interfere with gems installed by Pacman. (From Arch Wiki)

To install gems system-wide, see any of the methods listed on [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ruby#Installing_gems_system-wide)

```zsh
$ sudo gem install revdev
$ sudo gem install bundler
$ sudo gem install fusuma
```

#### 4. Install xdotool (optional)

For sending shortcuts:

```zsh
$ sudo pacman -S xdotool
```

### Touchpad not working in GNOME

Ensure the touchpad events are being sent to the GNOME desktop by running the following command:

```bash
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events enabled
```

## Usage

```bash
$ fusuma
```

## Update

```bash
$ sudo gem update fusuma
```

## Customize Gesture Mapping

You can customize the settings for gestures to put and edit `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.  
**NOTE: You will need to create the `~/.config/fusuma` directory if it doesn't exist yet.**

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/fusuma        # create config directory
$ nano ~/.config/fusuma/config.yml # edit config file.
```


### Available gestures

* `swipe:`
  * support `3:`, `4:` fingers
  * support `left:`, `right:`, `up:`, `down:` directions
* `pinch:`
  * support `2:`, `3:`, `4:` fingers
  * support `in:`, `out:` directions
* `rotate:`
  * support `2:`, `3:`, `4:` fingers
  * support `clockwise:`,`counterclockwise:` directions

### About YAML Basic Syntax

- Comments in YAML begins with the `#` character.
- Comments must be separated from other tokens by whitespaces.
- Indentation of whitespace is used to denote structure.
- Tabs are not included as indentation for YAML files.

### Example: Gesture Mapping for Ubuntu

https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma/wiki/Ubuntu

```yaml
swipe:
  3:
    left:
      command: "xdotool key alt+Right" # History forward 
    right:
      command: "xdotool key alt+Left" # History back
    up:
      command: "xdotool key super" # Activity
    down:
      command: "xdotool key super" # Activity
  4:
    left:
      command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down" # Switch to next workspace
    right:
      command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up" # Switch to previous workspace
    up:
      command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down" # Switch to next workspace
    down:
      command: "xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up" # Switch to previous workspace
pinch:
  in:
    command: "xdotool keydown ctrl click 4 keyup ctrl" # Zoom in
  out:
    command: "xdotool keydown ctrl click 5 keyup ctrl" # Zoom out
```

If you have a nice configuration, please share `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml` with everyone.

### Threshold and Interval

if `command:` properties are blank, the swipe/pinch doesn't execute command.

`threshold:` is sensitivity to swipe/pinch. Default value is 1.
If the swipe's threshold is `0.5`, shorten swipe-length by half.

`interval:` is delay between swipes/pinches. Default value is 1.
If the swipe's interval is `0.5`, shorten swipe-interval by half to recognize a next swipe.

### Example of `threshold:` / `interval:` settings

```yaml
swipe:
  3: 
    left: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Right' # threshold: 0.5, interval: 0.75
      threshold: 0.5
    right: 
      command: 'xdotool key alt+Left' # threshold: 0.5, interval: 0.75
      threshold: 0.5
    up: 
      command: 'xdotool key super' # threshold: 1, interval: 0.75
    down: 
      command: 'xdotool key super' # threshold: 1, interval: 0.75
pinch:
  2: 
    in:
      command: "xdotool keydown ctrl click 4 keyup ctrl" # threshold: 0.5, interval: 0.5
    out:
      command: "xdotool keydown ctrl click 5 keyup ctrl" # threshold: 0.5, interval: 0.5

threshold:
  pinch: 0.5

interval:
  swipe: 0.75
  pinch: 0.5
```

There are three priorities of `threshold:` and `interval:`.  
The individual `threshold:` and `interval:` settings (under "direction") have a higher priority than the global one (under "root")

1. child elements in the direction (left/right/down/up → threshold/interval)
1. root child elements (threshold/interval → swipe/pinch)
1. default value (= 1)

### `command:` property for assigning commands

On fusuma version 0.4 `command:` property is available!
You can assign any command each gestures.

**`shortcut:` property is deprecated**, **it was removed on fusuma version 1.0**.
You need to replace to `command:` property.

```diff
swipe:
  3:
    left:
-      shortcut: 'alt+Left'
+      command: 'xdotool key alt+Left'
    right:
-      shortcut: 'alt+Right'
+      command: 'xdotool key alt+Right'
```
