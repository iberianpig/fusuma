### Generic smell configuration

detectors:
#   # You can disable smells completely
#   IrresponsibleModule:
#     enabled: false
  UncommunicativeVariableName:
      enabled: false

#
#   # You can use filters to silence Reek warnings.
#   # Either because you simply disagree with Reek (we are not the police) or
#   # because you want to fix this at a later point in time.
#   NestedIterators:
#     exclude:
#       - "MyWorker#self.class_method" # should be refactored
#       - "AnotherWorker#instance_method" # should be refactored as well
#
#   # A lot of smells allow fine tuning their configuration. You can look up all available options
#   # in the corresponding smell documentation in /docs. In most cases you probably can just go
#   # with the defaults as documented in defaults.reek.yml.
#   DataClump:
#     max_copies: 3
#     min_clump_size: 3


# ### Directory specific configuration
#
# # You can configure smells on a per-directory base.
# # E.g. the classic Rails case: controllers smell of NestedIterators (see /docs/Nested-Iterators.md) and
# # helpers smell of UtilityFunction (see docs/Utility-Function.md)
# # Note that we only allow configuration on a directory level, not a file level, so all paths have to point to directories.
# directories:
#   "web_app/app/controllers":
#     NestedIterators:
#       enabled: false
#   "web_app/app/helpers":
#     UtilityFunction:
#       enabled: false

# ### Excluding directories
#
# # Directories below will not be scanned at all
# exclude_paths:
#   - lib/legacy
#   - lib/rake/legacy_tasks
